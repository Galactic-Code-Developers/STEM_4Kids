## 🚀 About the Project

This repository hosts interactive content, modular lesson plans, simulations, and visual learning tools designed for children who learn differently—including those with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, or physical challenges. Everything we build is:

- ✅ **Open-source**
- 🧩 **Modular and adaptable**
- 🖍️ **Visually intuitive**
- 🔊 **Multi-sensory and assistive-tech friendly**

We develop in alignment with modern cognitive science and universal design principles.

> 🧬 A note from a scientist on the spectrum:

As a physicist and educator with Asperger's syndrome and dyslexia, I know firsthand how traditional learning environments can exclude brilliant minds. This project is personal. It’s about ensuring that no child feels left behind simply because their brain works differently.

Science gave me a universe to belong to—this initiative is how we give it back.

🌟 Please consider supporting us at $5 or $10/month to help build tools that speak the language of every learner.
